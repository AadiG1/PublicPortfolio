- Developed Site on Cursor

Intro

- For my site I used Cursor to build my personal website and it completely changed the way I will think about projects because I am more of software developer that tends to stay away from AI for plagirism purposes. I expected AI to be limited to autocomplete or simple debugging help because that is what I usually used it for. So basically all I did was prompt engineer in cursor then connect my GitHub repository, linked it to Cloud Build, and selected the Dockerfile to deploy the project.

AI as Tool
